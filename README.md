### Hi! I'm Ian Culanag ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a passionate Software Engineer with over four (4) years of professional experience building distributed applications as a Java Backend Engineer. I have been working remotely for the past four years and I have established a great work ethic to work independently and adapt to any codebase and working environment I have been with. I've experienced taking ownership of development processes from the ground up and have worked with globally-distributed teams. In my role, I have been involved in all parts of the software development lifecycle, from design, development, testing, and deployment, coordinating with stakeholders, writing documentation, feature presentations, I have a proven track-record of being a well-rounded developer.

## Work Experience

Here are the projects that I've worked on:

- ETL Applications for E-commerce platforms with Java and Spring Batch (Rogers Communications Canada)
- App Integrations with Java, Spring, and Kafka (The Warehouse Group)
- User Account Management System (Palmify)
- Report Generation Systems (Yondu)
- Multi-tenant B2B E-commerce application (Rhythm for Commerce)
